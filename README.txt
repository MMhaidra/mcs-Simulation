My fourth year masters project was on muon tomography, specifically I was investigating how changing variables affected how muons scattered through an object of a given material (uranium, iron, lead and water). 
The first simulation was not mine, I added some more features such as the ability to scatter through water and producing a third histogram given an uncertainity in the muon momentum.

The second simulation, titled "mcsSimulation" was created by me and instead of just generating values through the use of an equation, it actually ran the muons through a simulated set up of detectors and the object to scatter through and updated their position over a time step.
both simulations output various graphs upon completion which i used to fine tune them and draw conclusions. I have attatched a copy of my thesis which talks about the results and more.
